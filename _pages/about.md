I am currently a second-year PhD student at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou), where I am privileged to be supervised by Professor [Ying Congchen](https://www.yingcong.me/).

My research interests are primarily focused on controllable generative tasks. This field fascinates me as it blends rigorous scientific inquiry with the limitless possibilities of generative models. Through my work, I aim to contribute to advancements in this area, potentially revolutionizing how we understand and implement generative technologies in various applications.
